Please respect the Supercell <a href="http://supercell.com/en/terms-of-service/" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>RESPECT OTHER PLAYERS.</strong> No personal attacks, discrimination or harassment on others. Keep all conversations respectful and polite. Only chat in English so everybody can understand.</span><br></li><li><span style="font-size: 1.25rem; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;<strong>ALL PROMOTIONS ARE EARNED.</strong> Elder is given after 1000 donations in the main clan <a href="https://clashofclans.com/clans/clan?clanTag=9C8VL099">3rd Eye Vision</a> and after 500 donations in the secondary clan Road To 3rd Eye. Co-leader is only given to those who show long-term loyalty, helpfulness, as well as leadership skills. Do not beg for promotions.</span></li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>KEEP DONATIONS BALANCED.</strong> While we haven't set any specific minimum donation ratios, please don't abuse the system. If you receive troops regularly, you should be also prepared to donate sometimes.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>ONLY DONATE WHAT IS ASKED. </strong>Please read the requests carefully before donating. Accidents happen sometimes, we get it, but just try to be careful.</li><li>&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; WE HAVE CERTAIN TROOP REQUEST RESTRICTIONS. </strong>Only request heavy Dark Elixir troops for war, trophy pushing or practice attacks, as people usually try to save their Dark Elixir. Also do not add any minimum level in your normal farming troop requests; this gives everyone a fair chance to donate.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> NO RECKLESS KICKING OR INVITING.</strong> Only the leader and co-leaders are allowed to kick or invite players. Elders shouldn't kick or invite anyone without permission to do so. Everyone must be warned at least once before getting kicked, unless the violation is clearly intentional.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>​</p><h2>WAR RULES</h2><p>​</p><p><br></p><ul><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>PARTICIPATION IN WAR IS OPTIONAL.</strong> If you want to participate, just set the Clan Wars sign in your profile GREEN. If you wish to stay out, then set the sign RED. If you want to make sure you are included (or not included) in the next war team, also chat with the leader in-game.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>ONLY TOP PLAYERS SHOULD FILL DEFENDING WAR CLAN CASTLES. </strong>Higher level troops simply make the attack harder for the enemy.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong> &nbsp; USE BOTH ATTACKS. </strong>If you decided to participate in war, you must use both of your war attacks. If you face a sudden problem that prevents you from attacking, you should let us know as early as possible. Failure to do so can result you sitting out of the future wars or even get you kicked.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>USE WAR ARMY.</strong> You should always use your best troops for war attacks. You must have ALL spells, ALL heroes and FULL clan castle if you are warring in the main clan <a href="https://clashofclans.com/clans/clan?clanTag=9C8VL099">3rd Eye Vision</a>. You can war without heroes or spells ONLY in the secondary clan <a href="https://clashofclans.com/clans/clan?clanTag=R8RRPLG9">Road To 3rd Eye</a>.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> FOLLOW WAR PLAN.</strong> The plan is sent in clan mail before every war. You must follow the instructions and hit the right target. Usually players with Town Hall level 8 or below are expected to use their both attacks in the first 12 hours.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
