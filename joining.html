Direct invitations to the main clan are also possible but naturally it requires that you know someone from the clan already, or meet them within the game. It doesn't even matter which clan you join at first, because the idea is that members can move between the clans rather freely. Members of both clans can sometimes be asked to temporarily move to the other clan to help them with something, depending on the current situation. However, our intention is never to force anyone to move.</p><p>​</p><h1>REQUIREMENTS</h1><h1><br></h1><ul><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Must speak English fairly well.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; All ages welcome but must behave maturely.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Any Town Hall levels accepted but must have some experience from clan wars.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Must not have active war eligibility timer.</li></ul><p><br></p><h1>STEP BY STEP GUIDE</h1><h1><br></h1><ul><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Leave in-game application in our second clan <a href="https://clashofclans.com/clans/clan?clanTag=R8RRPLG9">Road To 3rd Eye</a>. Rarely, if the clan happens to be closed, you can contact us via the LINE App. Inside the app, add new contact by LINE ID: <em><strong>sifavision</strong></em>. Tell that you would like to have the clan opened and we will do it for you.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaders and co-leaders will then check your profile discuss with you whether you would like to move to another clan or not. In general, new members who would like to war with the main clan must first demonstrate their reliability and ability to cooperate by participating in at least one war in the second clan.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you are a member, you still have to remain active in order to stay and participate in wars. If you know you're going to be busy in the future, please mark the war sign in your profile RED and also let us know so you won't get kicked. We highly encourage all members to join our LINE chat group so that we can communicate even if you can't access the game sometimes. Simply download the App and contact the above-mentioned LINE ID: <strong><em>sifavision</em></strong> to be invited to the group. Again, if you have any problems, please read our step by step LINE Guide.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>
